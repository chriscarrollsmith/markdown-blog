## Programming philosophy

Keep commits atomic. Always make the smallest code changes that will achieve your goals.

## Resolving Github issues

If asked to resolve a Github issue, check if you're already on an issue branch with `git branch -v`. If not, check if an issue branch already exists with `git branch -r`.

If no issue branch exists, you can create one and switch to it with `gh issue develop $ISSUE_NUMBER -c` (assuming you have set the `ISSUE_NUMBER` variable in your shell).

Make your changes, validate them, then open a pull request like `gh pr create -t "Descriptive title" -b $(cat temp/summary_of_changes.md)` (assuming you have written a `temp/summary_of_changes.md` file).

## Python dependency management with `uv`

This project uses `uv` to manage dependencies and run Python files.

Add Python dependencies to the workspace like:

```bash
uv add pydantic # add --dev flag for development dependencies
```

## Python programming patterns

Always write type-annotated Python code that will pass a `mypy` check.

## HTML templating patterns

Avoid introducing new named CSS classes. This project is themed, and the theme should mostly be controlled by element selectors rather than class or id selectors.

## Markdown style

`python-markdown` strictly complies with the `markdown.pl` spec, so it's essential to write well-formed Markdown. In particular, make sure to separate block-level elements from each other with a blank line. Thus:

``` markdown
**Don't do this**
- List item will be incorrectly concatenated in `<p>` with list title
```

``` markdown
**Do this instead**

- List item will be correctly formatted as `<ul>`
```

Also, make sure to use four spaces rather than two for indenting nested list items:

``` markdown
- First level
    - Second level
```
